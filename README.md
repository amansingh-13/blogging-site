## Blogger
This is a basic blogging site created by me, purely using Django, as a project assigned by DevCom. Here is what you can do with it : <br/>

- <b>Login/Signup</b> into your account
- Read <b>Top Posts</b> of the same day/week/month/year
- <b>Upvote/Downvote</b> any blog posts
- <b>Comment</b> on any blog post
- <b>Publish</b> your own blog post
- <b>Edit/Delete</b> your own blog posts

<b><i>All the personal views are secured</i></b>, i.e., anonymous and other logged in users can't add/edit/delete posts or comment on your behalf. As adding functionalities was the main motive for the project, not design, very minimal css (only for making navbar) was used.
