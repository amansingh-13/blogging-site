## Blogger!
This is a basic blogging site created by me, purely using Django, as a project assigned by DevCom. I have hosted the site here : [http://amansingh0.pythonanywhere.com/]. So you can check it out if you want.* <br><br>
Also, here is what you can do with the site : <br/>

- <b>Signup/Login</b> into your account
- Read <b>Top Posts</b> of the same day/week/month/year
- <b>Upvote/Downvote</b> any blog posts
- <b>Comment</b> on any blog post
- <b>Publish</b> your own blog post
- <b>Edit/Delete</b> your own blog posts

<b><i>All the personal views are secured</i></b>, i.e., anonymous and other logged in users can't add/edit/delete posts or comment on your behalf. As adding functionalities was the main motive for the project, not design, very minimal css (only for making navbar, code taken from w3schools) was used.
